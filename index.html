      As day break marks the end of my restful sleep,<br>
      I release all energy not mine to keep.<br>
      Fill that void with peace, love and white light,<br>
      Spirit, please guide me today true and right.<br>
      Shield me from darkness that may come my way,<br>
      So that in serenity I will remain all day. Àṣẹ. <br><br>
      
      <b>REMOVE CORDS & CALL BACK MY POWER #2 - 3x</b><br>
      Divine spirit within me, lift my energy && raise my vibration. Purify my power && bless this call.<br>                                                
      Universal love, descend into my soul; free my essence from all lack && limitation.<br>                          
      By the Power of the Most High, I release all cords && bindings that no longer serve my highest && best good. <br>
      Spirit, return all power && energy to me - that is mine by divine right from Source - cleansed, whole, renewed && pure.<br>                              
      Let this incantation empower my higher self, to guide my soul's intent && manifest my highest good. Àṣẹ.<br><br>
      
      <b>CLOSING</b><br>
      I RELEASE MYSELF FROM THE BURDENS OF THE PAST.
      I NOURISH MYSELF IN BLESSED SACRED LIGHT.
      I AM RESTORED. I AM RECHARGED. <br>
      So shall it be, and so it is, so it is, so it is. Àṣẹ.<br><br>
